## Report
In computational formulations of intrinsic motivation for exploration in Reinforcement Learning domains, the theory of Learning Progress Motivation is an established paradigm in current research.
As an alternative, we put forward a computational formulation of the psychological theory of Competence Progress Motivation, that builds upon Learning Progress Motivation and reflects a more modern notion of intrinsic motivation.
To that end, we first discuss a theoretical framework and implement a prototype for the [ManiSkill2 Challenge](https://sapien.ucsd.edu/challenges/maniskill/).
